#### Comparing Two Population Means: Paired Difference Experiments
To combat red-light-running crashes, many states are installing red light cameras at dangerous intersections. The Virginia Department of Transportation conducted a study in Fairfax County, Virginia to see if photo-red enforcement programs are effective in reducing red-light-running crashes at intersections. The study provides crash data (measured as the number of crashes caused by red light running per intersection per year) before and after installing red light cameras at 13 randomly selected intersections. We will use a one sample t-test on the sample of differences to see if the true mean number of crashes at at intersections with installed cameras is less than the true mean number of crashes at intersections without cameras. 

#### Assumptions Required for Valid Small-Sample Inferences about ud

1. A random sample of differences is selected from the target population of differences.

2. The population of differences has a distribution that is approximately normal.
